# Object Recognition using OpenCV and Java

Hello, thanks for checking out our java app. It was a class project so its pretty simple. Room for improvement.

Requirements: Java version 8 or greator
              1 or more webcams

In order to use the app, you are going to need some haar cascade models. Some models have been provided within the folder titled: DefaultCascadeClassifiers

To add more haar cascade model files to the app, click on the settings button and fill out the fields at the bottom of the app window.

To remove a haar cascade model from being used by the app, simply click the X button next to the model data at the top of the window in the settings screen.

To begin detecting objects, simply click the On/Off button. If the button is green, then that means the object detection has started.

To end the object detection, simply click the On/Off button once more. The button should return to its original color.
